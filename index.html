Event Anchor:
So what's so fascinating about the 2 gentlemen? What's so fascinating about the 2 gentlemen who are our lifetime lifetime achievement award winners is how different their parts were. And I call upon Nirupa Kaushik, who is consulting partner landscape to come up and tell us a little bit. Lifetime also Lifetime Achievement Award winner, 2023.

Nirupa Kaushik:
I have a clicker on remote. Very efficient. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's a huge honor to be here and a huge privilege to introduce your own boss, lest I am accused of nepotism. Deep longitudinal. Cautions over a 10 year. Triangulation of data via insight and independent validations are the basis of what I'm going to be saying today. Planish doesn't need an introduction and it's hard to summarize someone as brilliant and as multifaceted as him just want to give you a glimpse and a ringside view of what makes the professional the man and the magic that is pranesh. Let's start at the very beginning. Where do we begin? “Wo jahan pe khade the”, very few people can do what he did and right from his childhood he had this amazing ability to live up to expectation and completely surprise you. Do you know that we have a star in our midst, pranesh on a holiday in Shimla while studying in Kirori, Mal College featured in a movie called. Kalicharan so Bollywood losses, clearly. The Insight industries gain and what can we say? He was a star then, and he's a star now, right? And the son of an IPS professional was obviously expected to do the ifs or the IAS, but he chose chose IAM instead. So the ability to innovate and make his own mark. “Wohise toh suru huatha sabkuch”, And who better to tell us that that nobody can tell it better than a feisty 92 year old who tells it like it is can? We have the video.

After every leader. So you can't say more pity than that, and the interesting story she shared with us, which we don't have on video, is there's always a man in a hurry. Apparently by the time he was born, the midwife did not even make it, so she just delivered and “line wohi se Shuru huithi”. It, and it was a straight up graph in an organization. The iconic Lintas low Lintas. He began there as a management trainee with some very legendary names. Some of those who will recognize almost immediately, and after several stints across client development across business management. Across building research muscle in a wonderful organization called Pathfinders and 2 Charvat as he likes to call. He signed off on a high note as President and CEO of Lintas, capping a wonderful career that combined advertising, creativity, insight and strategy. But wait was not just over. That was just the first chapter. Let's hear some voices from his time at. Lintas these were his senior colleagues, and their law talked to you about his sense of quirkiness, fun, creativity, and the ability to bring together strategy and creativity in a seamless fat. He had some people whom you recognize today as very senior in the industries, but these were his bachas people. He trained and there's a lovely little story from Serena about how when they waited for a meeting for a certain amount of time for a client very quietly said, shall we move, talking about the value of giving respect, but equally. Getting it as well. And clients like Ali Raza Khan talking about his commitment, his humility, his affability, that do not, you know, in any way next to none. “Wo to he hi albelle”. I know he'll be cringing while watching this slide. We had to literally extract this from him several, several honors. Including the Efes visiting professor at IIM. Calcutta Solutions for pathfinders, which even today meet the industry standards and the Indonesian Life Boy success story, which is validated market across market. The man whose best friend colleague at one point reporting into him a client and a collaborator stands kannathal.

Client: 
I can't think of another person who deserves this more than you do. I've known you for 40 years and I can't believe that, you know, 40 years have flown by since I first met you at Express Stars in relevant. When I think of Pranesh, there are 3 phrases that come to my mind. Number one is the phrase humble confidence and the second one is quietly effective and the 3rd one is brilliant thinker. You put all these 3. What comes out is an incredible professional. And also a wonderful human being.
“Wo to he Albele  but hazarome hai akele” because after you finish being President and CEO of Lindas, what you do next. You decide to start an organization. That is, if you're Pradesh. So he gave in to his entrepreneurial start and began in a very humble small office in Chembur. And began with something which is quite pre signed at the time because we talk about 18 years ago, triangulation through data through insight, through analytics to provide actionable accelerating growth insights and some collaborators from the time testify to brands. It's incredible journey.
So I've known pranesh for more than 15 years now. When he started his journey as the MD of Grand Scapes. What can I say? Such a wonderful person? You know, just being a wonderful woman, even getting this award from Mars. I think Ganesh is one of the best human beings, a great people person, a fantastic manager and leader of people and he's got. A hand on the pulse of marketing activities of what is happening and what companies want.
Bobby Gupta:
You've been a pioneer tapping into that talent, talent of people who had so much to give to the industry. But we're looking for probably more flexibility and balance and you managed to tap into them and give them this, this approach of like working with. The best clients and the best brands to contribute. The fact that you managed to go out and expand the footprint of where we can source our talent from, not just from big towns in India, but also to the next and the next level.

So as we would say, Odisha 's Golden Boy Shona Munda is doing Kamal even today, because today brand skips is an adult 18 years of age. We are 350 plus people, 7 officers and in in a very interesting way. Pranesh gave back very early by. Choosing to set up office in the Tier 2 city like Bhuvaneshwar, which is clearly very much ahead of. First time Liz Morales key client.
Yay, congratulations for this, for winning this prestigious award. And thank you for the strategic partnership of BRANDSCAPES.

Other Speakers:
You and your wonderful team have been helping us achieve our growth. And more power to gransky. Congratulations again, pernis.
This wonderful message from Rohit Java where he talks about the entire journey that Pranesh has taken, but just one thing I'd like to highlight in that message is that. Achievement upon achievement. But he did not sit back on his laurels and he decided his going strength to strength in terms of reinventing his impact. By creating brand scapes and giving back to the industry, which is all that matters. B Pradeep and other familiar face and Mrs I zone.
OK, 19771 of the better decisions we took.
It has been my unique privilege to have been your client partner across my research career, starting with India, then London and Singapore. During these years I made 2 observations about you. The first one is their obsession to deliver top quality research and insights every time. And the second is your deep listening skills. So much so that in every meeting or being with you, I've seen you do your signature known over the through the meeting and at the very end you come up with this unique, amazing, cryptic conclusions and suggestions.

19771 of the better decisions we took at Lintas was to invite Pranesh Misra to join us. When we met him at the I am placement office. In the days in those days, advertising was still a sexy career and it was possible for us to seduce Pranesh. To join us. That was when the agency business was transitioning from the creative Shop syndrome to a serious business activity. And moving into the hands of professionally trained managers. Banish grew rapidly within the organization based on the special abilities as a thinker strategy planner. And a serious professional. Over the years he ran our Calcutta office, ran and grew a research division, pathfinders, and finally led our advertising business nationally, all to much success. Of the entire Spanish. Surprised many with his entrepreneurial skills as he went on to build a large growing business of his own. Brand scapes is now a global organization serving large clients internationally. Pranesh has a special ability to add value to whatever he takes up in a uniquely understated manner. In all the years I've known him, I do not recall an incident when he lost his temper to make his point. And each time he got his way.

And all work and no play could make Jack a dull boy. But Pradesh is in no danger of that whatsoever. The heart of every party really, really 2 killer things that he has a killer smile. That's how he gets people to sign up for audacious and crazy things. And the meanest dance moves that you've seen in a long, long time. So all the best flourish going forward, Manzella, Orbi, Hai picture Abhi Baat, Kuch Baaki, Mera Dost and we look forward to much more from him. Ladies and gentlemen, Paresh Mishra.

Thank you. For what? That lovely insight on Pranesh 's journey and all the work you did in putting that together, I now call upon our ex presidents to hand over. The award to Pranesh Praveen Tripathi from Magic 9 media consumer knowledge. Our ex president and our current ex officio, Sandeep Arora, President digital experience for Datamatics Global solutions. If you'll please come on stage.

Pranesh Misra:
Wow. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, members of MRSI executive Committee, members of MRSI, the jury members and all the dignitaries present here. My heartfelt thanks to Mrs for giving me this award. It's one of the most coveted awards that that I. It's a coveted award that I've really enjoyed getting and I couldn't believe that you're giving me this award. I'll tell you why. Because. I have although I started my career in market research, I've been meandering into different areas like getting into advertising, into marketing, into analytics, into brand consulting into strategy planning and I've not been a true blue blood researcher like partner. And Partha has been really a core person in the research business. I have been meandering across different professions though. The market research label stuck with me wherever I went, and it actually became a differentiator in a way that I was sort of putting a point of view which was different. So I really appreciate this, this honor. And I would like to thank the jury for considering me worthy of this honor. It's a it's a big deal. For me, thank you. Getting this award from Mrs I is also got a personal sort of sense of belonging with Mrs, because I remember in the mid 1980s when a group of the doyens of market research that time Ranjit Sheth Ramesh Dharani. Dorab supari wala Titu wala walia op ninjara and a few other very very senior people got together and we used to meet for coffee in the Taj Mahal Hotel Coffee shop. Sometimes in the over a coffee shop, sometimes saying that we should get together and I was just a new kid on the block. Having at 3031 heading pathfinders, the new agency that that was set up by Lintas I I therefore have a very, very strong attachment with the brand MRSI which from that very small inception has become such a powerful, globally recognized body and a power. Powerhouse of of market research. So it it's really personal. Personally, I feel very privileged to be getting this award from RSI. I have to do 2 things today. I want to thank a few people at their hundreds and thousands people who who I would like to thank, but there are few people which who I would like to take this opportunity to thank. And I would really start with the hands of the Almighty. I see the hands of the Almighty God. Almighty, being with me right from through my life, every time I was in, in, in a problem I had faith. And had a positive outlook and everything happened there was I think I would like to thank the supreme power for being with me and giving me a disproportionate share of luck and good fortune right through my career. And that's that's really a blessing that I I really can't. All the time. My father was a police officer, a poet and author, a literature, and he was all rolled into one. One of the things is to tell me and one of the things that stuck with me is what a man can do. Another man can do better that that was the kind of proverb that stuck with me. And he it told he gave me the he gave me the the. Confidence that if you are passionate about doing something, you can do it. There are no barriers and that philosophy stayed with me right through my life. As I move from one area to another, I was sort of testing myself saying I can. I do it. Can I do it? And can I do it? So I remember my father. And I hope from up there is looking at me and smiling today that I'm getting this award. The other person I'm I'm really thinking of. He saw my mother at 92. She's got such a grit and determination that you can believe it. She will get up at 5:30 in the morning. Call the auto rickshaw neighborhood auto rickshaw and go to the ashram because he had to perform perform. Responsibilities there. There do the guru Pada Puja or whatever it is there. She's got such energy and she's such an inspiration not only to me, but for a for my entire family. So I would like to really thank her for those qualities and values that she she has given me. But don't believe all the very positive things that you heard about me from from the on the videos that Nirupama presented you, you have to ask my wife Mamta about the real me because ** *** will tell you how pig headed. I can be. How? Uncompromising and how difficult a person I am to to deal with at home. And she is the only reason that I have maintained a sane out exterior in the outside world because at home I have a very, very difficult person. So thank you, Mamta. He is here with us. And thank you so much for being a part of my life in, in this this 474645. 36 years of marriage and I hope it goes on forever. Then I I really didn't do want to talk to talk about some people who shaped my career teachers, and we know our big inspirations and I would like to really call out 2 teachers that have impacted my career at in IIMA. There's professors, Subrato Sengupta, who was teaching advertising management. Course and there was Professor Labdi Bhandari who was teaching market research and information systems at at Ahmedabad. And these are the 2 people who got me so passionately sort of interested in the area of both advertising, marketing and market research that the only jobs I wanted to take on were in market research or advertising. Linda has offered both, so I said this is the company that I need to go to and fortunately they were kind enough to consider me as the as a candidate and I joined with bunch of very illustrious people like Rama and Rags Raghavan and a few other Anand hallway in the same batch. And it was. It was a really joy to be a part of that Lintas organization, which I came, kept going out of, but always coming back, you know, I did took her offices, not just one. So those are the 2 people who shaped my interest in the business. But there are some gurus that I came through and the first guru that I would like to name is Ramesh Thadani, Ramesh. Was just back from his stint in the US. He had done his NBA or whatever he did that that Ms I think in his management. And I used to go to the Clarion offices in those the clarions really something that you'll not many of you will not know. But it was very strong advertising agency with the research division called Core and Ramesh was the deputy general manager of core and I used to bump into him in the corridors and he got talking and said here's the man I can learn so much. Right. Such that I should work for him and that translated into a job offer. So I left Lintas the first time within 7 months of joining the company because I want I was so admired, so enamored with the the knowledge and the strength that Ramesh brought to the party that I sort of went and worked for him. And I think I had learned most of my grounding in market research came out of working with Ramesh. Many of you might some of you might have worked with ramen. Which I think apart from market research, she told me, he taught me how to be frugal in your ways. You're you're using clients money. Don't spare splurge. It don't splurge it on 5 star hotels. Stay in the in the tier Tier 2 hotels. Don't splurge it on air, air travel. If you can go there by train. Were there these are the kind of values that he taught me which I think stayed with me even till till now. I I would not want to just go and spend money because whatever money I can spend. They can actually go back to the clients hands, so that's that's the kind of learning that I got. The second guru that I have to talk about is I like padamsee, the CEO and the chairman of Lintas for several years. And he's been, I'm really fortunate. For having had the opportunity to work with Alec, Alec is a brilliant creative person. Everybody knows him as a brilliant creative person, but he's also a fantastic marketing mind. I was managing test Calcutta, then, Alex said. I want to come and run. Pathfinders, I said. Alex, is this a punishment posting? Have I done anything wrong? Why do you want to take take me into into pathfinders? He said. No, no, no. I see a vision. I see that you have the capability to make this company. You and you should come and I will. I will help you grow it. And he did help me grow it in those years. Those are really lovely years in pathfinders from 8085 to 9192 that I've spent with him. But apart from our pathfinders, he also put me as a permanent member of the Strategy Review Board of Lintas. Which basically met every Wednesday to talk about one campaign that the agency was working on and we would through Pathfinder, do some research, get the voice of consumer, and discuss the strategy. And that was fascinating for me because it is not only. The consumer understanding, but also how it translates into actual strategy. So one of those incidents that I remember is there's a condom client and we did a lot of research and condom as presenting the sort of statistical data, then some qualitative research data. And one of the courts that we usually put in in the in the story is consumer quotes. So one of the quotes was led using a condom. Is like swimming with a. Raincoat on. Right. So that that is a court that that he caught on to using a condom is like swimming with a raincoat on. He said that that's it. You know, the biggest hurdle to the category is that it's a pleasure killer. It should become a pleasure enhancer. And that's I could see the sparks flying in that. It's that suddenly gave birth to a brand which you all know, which is Kamasutra. Kamasutra. Condom was lost. So I was really enjoying not only the doing part of research but the the part that was translating that into strategy and then to action and then to. The results? That was what was exciting about about me. The other person I would like to mention is another boss, Stanley Pinto, who was my boss in Calcutta. True blue human centric persons from but he used to know all our families used to know. Or spouses or children by name. He would still send me birthday greetings. So this human contact Connect is something that I learned from him. And then Prem, who's been quoted here, is a fantastic professional to work with, completely thorough. He would look at all the pros and cons. For making decisions, run totally successful. So these are 4 people I would sort of call out who who made my life really, really. I mean shape me and make made my life fantastic in in the last few years. Then of course, there are many other people that would like to thank, but I would like to read the call out my leadership team at brand skips who have been with me right from the inception. Rupa who you met Nirupama. Asha is here with with us. Parvati is in Dubai. Vivek and Soem are in. Atlanta and Satan. He is also here with us. Thank you very much my partners for making brands gives a successful company. And the 350 other people who have worked with us to make it make it successful. So a lot of people to thank. And I have just sort of selected a few to to thank because without them this this achievement would not have been possible. There are few things I want to share with the new generation. At the end. One is. Feel proud. I think the market research industry in India is a strong industry. It's a very strong industry and that realization came to me when I went out into the world to offer our services in Asia Pacific, in Europe, in the Middle East in the. Workers, the number of Indian market research professionals that dominate the world is incredible, and the power of the market research professionals, Indian market research professionals that are taking over the world is incredible. Whether they're in agencies or they're in clients. Anecdotally, when in Singapore. We were looking for diversity and I was recruiting people and get the head head under a list all the 80% of the shortlisted candidates were Indian origin. I said no, I don't want Indian origin. People said no, nobody else is available. You know, that's how we dominate the space. So feel. Proud of the fact that you have such fantastic knowledge base and such fantastic education and that is going to make you a winner anywhere in the world. You are second to none in in the world. The second suggestion I would do is after a while invest time in teaching. Invest time in going into this to the. Institutes or the MBA schools and teach? Because believe me, that's the best way to learn because if you teach and I've done it when I'm preparing for a lecture for 45 minutes or one and a half hours, I have to prepare for that lecture for about 8 hours because to be face. Facing a group of 4550 MBA students without having an answer, pat answer to the questions is is it is a difficult proposition. So I would say teach, teach, teach because that is that's going to really enhance your own knowledge going forward. The 3rd thing I would say is always develop a point of view. A point of market research is very good. At consumer understanding, OK, we we say that this is what the consumers think and this is what they believe. This is how they behave. That's where we tend to stop. We don't have a point of view. We don't usually offer a point of view saying that, OK, So what? So what next do you want the client to do? We stopped there. We say that that's not our territory. Please feel free and just be bit more creative saying that if this is what we know about the consumer and that's the strength that we have, let's take the next step and say So what can the client do with this information and what next should he do? Should it change the brand propositions or not? Don't stop but just reporting facts. And that's that's my other. Advice. Innovation is very important. Yeah, yeah. Innovation is very, very critical. And I can see a lot of work being done in on innovation and assigned to that is risk taking take risks because if you don't test, take risks, you will not know how good you can be. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much the jury.
